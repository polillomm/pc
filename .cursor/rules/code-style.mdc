- Method names SHOULD focus on the conceptual purpose rather than implementation details.
- NEVER use 'else' statements.
- NEVER use single letter variable names, not even in for loops. Use clear, descriptive, preferably two words minimal names, but carefully avoid overly verbose names.
- Variables names MUST convey the intention or purpose rather than describing their content, avoiding unnecessary synonyms.
- Variable names SHOULD reflect the primary flow, not conditional outcomes.
- Prefer value objects as custom primitive types rather than classes when possible.
- Boolean variables SHOULD start with "Is", "Should", "Has" etc prefixes.
- Use PascalCase format for the entire error message whenever possible.
- Prefer "Fail", "Error", "Invalid" suffixes instead of "FailedTo", "Cannot", "UnableTo" prefixes.
- Prefer "Read" prefix or "Factory" suffix instead of "Get" suffix.
- Prefer suffixes instead of prefixes for class and method names to preserve alphabetical order context.
- Use mechanism-describing nouns like Builder, Parser, or Factory as method name suffixes instead of action verbs prefixes.
- Avoid redundant prefixes in class attribute names when the context is already clear from the class name or surrounding code.
- Class attributes SHOULD be ordered by importance, followed by alphabetical order.
- Class required attributes SHOULD be placed before optional attributes.
- Watch for repeated creation of identical classes or configurations inside loops to avoid unnecessary allocations and improve performance.
- Prefer using Map and Set instead of Object and Array. Convert them to Object and Array only when necessary.
- Prefer keeping lines under 85 characters when possible, but can exceed when necessary.
- Avoid unnecessary line breaks, especially in simple struct initializations that can fit on a single line while remaining readable.
- NEVER export functions, except when they are helpers. Prefer exporting classes, one per file.
